Project 2
----------

This project cover topics related to:

* Flask
* SocketIO
* Channels Creation
* Private Messages

In this project it was possible to have a chat application. It allows to create channels and to send private messages to connected users.

The project contains a list of available channels and a list of online users. For this case, I do not use a database, so all the data will be deleted when the server stops.

I use Font Awesome for the icons and I modularize HTML pages in a base layout and all the others HTML extends from it.
